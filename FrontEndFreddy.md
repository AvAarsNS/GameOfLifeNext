The error you're encountering, "Property 'toHaveClass' does not exist on type 'JestMatchers<any>'", typically indicates that the Jest testing framework is not recognizing the custom matcher toHaveClass provided by the React Testing Library. This usually happens when the extended matchers from React Testing Library are not properly integrated into Jest. To resolve this issue, ensure that Jest is set up to use the extended matchers from React Testing Library.

Here are the steps to address this:
1. Install @testing-library/jest-dom

If you haven't already, ensure that @testing-library/jest-dom is installed in your project as it provides the toHaveClass matcher:

bash

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom

2. Import and Extend Expect

In your test file or in a setup file that is included in your Jest configuration, you need to import @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect to add the custom matchers to Jest. You can do this at the top of your test file:

javascript

import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';

Alternatively, if you have a Jest setup file that is loaded when your tests run (specified in your Jest configuration), you can place the import there to make it available globally across all test files.
3. Update Jest Configuration

If you're using a Jest configuration file (like jest.config.js), ensure that it includes the setup file where @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect is imported. For example:

javascript

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/path/to/your/jest-setup-file.js'],
};

In the jest-setup-file.js, you should have the import statement for @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect.
4. Re-run the Tests

After making these changes, re-run your tests. The toHaveClass matcher should now be recognized correctly by Jest.

These steps should resolve the issue and allow you to use all the matchers provided by @testing-library/jest-dom, including toHaveClass.
